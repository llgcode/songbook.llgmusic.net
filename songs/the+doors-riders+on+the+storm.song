Em            A       Em7    A
Riders on the storm          
Em            A       Em     A
Riders on the storm          
  Am                  B/A    C/A      D/A
Into this house we're born            
  Em                   A       Em   A
Into this world we're thrown        
     D
Like dog without a bone
    C
An actor out on loan
Em             A     Em7    A
Riders on the storm     
    
          Em         A       Em7    A
There's a killer on the road        
             Em             A      Em7   A
His brain is squirming like a toad       
     Am         Bm/A  C/A     D/A
Take a long holiday           
Em             A      Em7   A
Let your children play      
       D
If you give this man a ride
      C
Sweet family will die
Em         A      Em7   A
Killer on the road
