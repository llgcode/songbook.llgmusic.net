Natural mystic
artist: Bob Marley


    Dm   G   Am  Am
There's a natural mystic flow thru' the air,
       Dm       G        Am   Am
if you listen carefully now you will hear.
       Dm   Am
This could be the first trumpet,
     Dm      Am
might as well be the last.
     Dm            Am
Many more will have to suffer,
     Dm            Am
many more will have to die,
         Am  Am
don't ask me why.


Things are not the way they used to be, I won't tell no lie.
One and all have to face reality now.
'Tho I've tried to find the answer
to all the questions they ask.
'Tho I know it's impossible
to go living through the past,
don't tell no lie.

There's a natural mystic bloom thru' the air, can't keep them down.
If you listen carefully now you will hear.
