Verse:
G
We all came out to Montreux 
              C         G
On the Lake Geneva shoreline
G
To make records with a mobile 
   C                G
We didn't have much time
G
Frank Zappa and the Mothers 
                 C      G
Were at the best place around
G
But some stupid with a flare gun 
                 C      G
Burned the place to the ground

Chorus:
C            Ab    G
Smoke on the water and fire in the sky
C            Ab
Smoke on the water

Riff

Verse:
G
They burned down the gambling house 
                C     G
It died with an awful sound
G
A funky Claude was running in and out 
             C        G
Pulling kids outa the ground
G
When it all was over 
                C      G
We had to find another place
G
But Swiss time was running out
G                       C        G
It seemed that we would lose the race

Chorus:
C            Ab    G
Smoke on the water and fire in the sky
C            Ab
Smoke on the water

Riff

Verse:
G
We ended up at the Grand Hotel 
             C        G
It was empty cold and bare
G
But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside
C                G
Making our music there
G
With a few red lights a few old beds 
          C        G
We made a place to sweat
G
No matter what we get out of this 
             C        G
I know we'll never forget

Chorus:
C            Ab    G
Smoke on the water and fire in the sky
C            Ab
Smoke on the water

Riff
