Sitting On The Dock Of The Bay
Artist: Otis Redding

Verse:
G                      B7
Sitting in the morning sun;
        C                        A
I'll be sitting when the evening comes.
G                       B7
Watching the ships roll in
      C                    A
And I watch 'em roll away again, yeah.

Chorus:
G                          E
Sitting on the dock of the bay
             G           E
Watching the tide roll away.
         G                          A
I'm just sitting on the dock of the bay
        G        E
Wasting time.

Verse:
I left my home in Georgia
Headed for the 'Frisco bay
'Cause I had nothin to live for
And look like nothing's gonna come my way
So I'm just...

Chorus

Bridge:
G    D7                          G
Look like nothing's gonna change 
 D7        C                      G
Everything still remains the same 
  D7                        G          F
I can't do what people tell me to do.  
                      D
So I guess I'll remain the same.

Verse:
Sitting here resting my bones
And this loneliness won't leave me alone
It's two thousand miles I roamed
Just to make this dock my home
Now, I'm just...

Chorus
