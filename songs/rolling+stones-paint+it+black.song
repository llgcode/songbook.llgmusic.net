Paint it Black
artist: Rolling Stones



Em                     B7
I see a red door and I want it painted black
Em                  B7
No colors anymore I want them to turn black
Em D       G          D          Em
I  see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes
Em D       G       D      A7              B7
I  have to turn my head until my darkness goes

Em                       B7
I see a line of cars and they're all painted black
Em                            B7
With flowers and my love both never to come back
Em D          G          D         Em
I  see people turn their heads and quickly look away
Em     D        G    D       A7            B7
Like a new born baby it just happens ev'ry day

Em                       B7
I look inside myself and see my heart is black
Em                       B7
I see my red door and it has been painted black
Em    D         G     D       Em
Maybe then I'll fade away and not have to face the facts
Em   D        G      D       A7                  B7
It's not easy facin' up when your whole world is black

Em                           B7
No more will my green sea go turn a deeper blue
Em                             B7
I could not foresee this thing happening to you
Em  D      G     D       Em
If  I look hard enough into the settin' sun
Em D         G          D    A7               B7
My love will laugh with me before the mornin' comes

Em                     B7
I see a red door and I want it painted black
Em                  B7
No colors anymore I want them to turn black
Em D       G          D          Em
I  see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes
Em D       G       D      A7              B7
I  have to turn my head until my darkness goes

Em                          B7
Hmm,hmm,hmm,hmm,hmm,hmm,hmm,hmm,hmm,hmm,hmm,hmm,hmm
Em                          B7
Hmm,hmm,hmm,hmm,hmm,hmm,hmm,hmm,hmm,hmm,hmm,hmm,hmm

               Em
I wanna see it painted, painted black
B7
Black as night, black as coal
  Em                        B7
I wanna see the sun blotted out from the sky
               Em                                 B7
I wanna see it painted, painted, painted, painted black  Yeah!
