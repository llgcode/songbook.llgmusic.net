Crying lightning
artist: Arctic Monkeys


Am    G    C    E
 Am          F            Am          E
Outside the cafe by the cracker factory
            Am         G      C      E
You were practicing a magic trick

         Am          F            Am          E
And my thoughts got rude, as you talked and chewed
        Am           G        C     E
On the last of your pick and mix

                                 Am             F
Said youâ€™re mistaken if you're thinking that I haven't been caught
Am           E
cold before
       Am              G          C     E
As you bit into your strawberry lace

                           Am             F         Am           E
And then a flip in your attention in the form of a gobstopper
                Am              G         C      E       
Is all you had left and it was going to waste

Am
Your past-times, consisted of the strange
And twisted and deranged
And I love that little game you had called
Crying lightning
And how you like to aggravate the ice-cream man on rainy afternoons

Am

                      Am               F
The next time that I caught my own reflection
       Am              E
It was on it's way to meet you
Am             G        C         E
Thinking of excuses to postpone

                     Am                F
You never look like yourself from the side
          Am                E
But your profile could not hide
             Am             G         C           E
The fact you knew I was approaching your throne

            Am            F                   Am
With folded arms you occupied the bench like toothache
E                      Am                 G           C        E
Stood and puffed your chest out like you never lost a war

              Am              F           Am             E
And though I tried so not to suffer the indignity of a reaction
      Am                 G              C       G#
There was no cracks to grasp or gaps to claw

        F               Dm
And your past-times, consisted of the strange
     Am
And twisted and deranged
      Am                                      F
And I hate that little game you had called

        Dm
Crying lightning
                    Am                                            F
And how you like to aggravate the icky man on rainy afternoons

    Dm
Uninviting
    Am
But not half as impossible as everyone assumes
       F       Dm
You are crying lightning


Am                   Am
Your past-times, consisted of the strange
      Am
And twisted and deranged         
       Am                                     F
And I hate that little game you had called

        Dm            Am
Crying lightning
        Am            F
Crying lightning
        Dm            Am
Crying lightning
        Am
Crying lightning

    F                Dm
Your past-times, consisted of the strange
     Am
And twisted and deranged
       Am                                     F
And I hate that little game you had called
            Dm
